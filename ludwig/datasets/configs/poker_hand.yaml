description: |
  Each record is an example of a hand consisting of five playing cards
  drawn from a standard deck of 52. Each card is described using two
  attributes (suit and rank), for a total of 10 predictive attributes.
  There is one Class attribute that describes the "Poker Hand". The
  order of cards is important, which is why there are 480 possible
  Royal Flush hands as compared to 4.
