generation:
  temperature:
    ui_display_name: Temperature
    default_value_reasoning:
      Increasing the temperature will allow the model to generate more diverse sequences,
      but will also increase the likelihood of generating nonsense. As such, we recommend setting this value to
      something closer to 0 for classification tasks, and something closer to 1 for text generation tasks where the
      goal is to generate novel text.

  max_new_tokens:
    ui_display_name: Max New Tokens
    default_value_reasoning:
      Increasing the maximum number of new tokens will allow the model
      to generate longer sequences, but because inference time scales linearly with the sequence length,
      longer sequences will be much slower to generate. For classification tasks, it's generally better to
      use a smaller number of new tokens, while for text generation tasks, it's generally better to use a larger
      number of new tokens.
    expected_impact: 3
  num_beams:
    ui_display_name: Number of Beams
    default_value_reasoning:
      Increasing the number of beams will allow the model to generate more diverse sequences,
      but will also increase inference time. Some backends (like DeepSpeed) also do not support beam search.
      As such, we recommend leaving this as 1 in most cases, unless you're finding the quality of the generated
      sequences to be lacking.
